# NEAT-Algorithm-Doodle-Game

Here is my attempt to implement the NEAT algorithm (Neuro Evolution through Augmented Topologies) which evolves neural networks in an evolutive fashion.
It creates random mutations in the NN paramters (number of neurons in each layers, number of layers, activated/disactivated weights and adding/erasing
connections) and make them compete with each other.

The competition is reproducing the old doodle game in which little creatures called doodles need to go up as far as they can by boucing fron platforms to platforms.

This code has been made for an educational purpose and doest not intend to be efficient nor professional but to help me understand the mechanics between all
the concepts used in it.

The original paper from students of the university of Austin, Texas on which is mainly based this implementation 
can be found on : http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf

As of today the code may be not fully annotated yet but I will come back to it.
